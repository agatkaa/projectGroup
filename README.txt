Alternative-Augmentative Communication Software is an application which enables children to comunicate with their parents.
Users can choose images from list, drag&drop into the table.
The table is resizable, user can add rows and columns.
All configurations are saved into MySql database.



To build this application you need to change paths in file "config.ini".
They should look like these:
file_location='pathToWhereTheDownloadedProjectIs'/db/projekt_grupowy.sqlite
image_location_dir='pathToWhereTheDownloadedProjectIs'/assets/
Remove other paths written in file config.ini
